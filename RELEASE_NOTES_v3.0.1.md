## 🌟 The Vision

Education is most effective when it is **interactive, encouraging, and Socratic**. 

Generic AI chatbots fail in education because they **spoon-feed final numerical answers**, depriving learners of the cognitive struggle necessary to master chemistry. Furthermore, existing cloud AI systems demand costly subscription fees, constant internet connectivity, and compromise student privacy.

**Gayatri Chemistry Tutor** solves this paradigm through localized neural intelligence:
- **Pure Socratic Pedagogy:** Never reveals final solutions prematurely; guides students through analogies, targeted questions, and misconception remediation.
- **Zero Digital Divide:** Runs 100% offline on standard consumer hardware (including school laptops with 8 GB RAM) without requiring internet or expensive GPUs.
- **Absolute Data Sovereignty:** Student chats, mastery records, and cognitive progress remain strictly on the local machine with zero telemetry or cloud egress.

## ⚡ Technical Highlights & Production Benchmarks

### 🧠 1. Socratic Pre-Training & Alignment
- **Domain Specialization:** Fine-tuned on **2,500 curated Socratic dialogue trajectories** specifically calibrated to the NCERT/CBSE senior secondary chemistry syllabus.
- **5 Pedagogical Pillars Hardcoded in Model Weights:**
  1. **`EXPLAIN` Mode:** 4-tier scaffolding (Everyday Intuition $\to$ Formal Definition $\to$ Mathematical Law $\to$ Comprehension Check).
  2. **`QUESTION` Mode:** Calibrated numerical and conceptual problem posing.
  3. **`EVALUATE` Mode:** Real-time misconception diagnosis governed by the **Anti-Answer-Leakage Invariant** (diagnoses physical reasoning errors without giving away numerical answers).
  4. **`HINT` Mode:** Graduated 5-tier directional nudges.
  5. **`REMEDIATE` Mode:** Dynamic prerequisite backtracking along the curriculum dependency graph.

### 🔍 2. Sub-10ms Atomic Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)
- **Zero-VRAM Architecture:** Replaces heavy vector embedding models with lightweight, deterministic keyword and BM25 concept resolution.
- **Atomic Micro-Cards:** Structured curriculum cards (<75 tokens per card) providing factual NCERT grounding in **< 8 ms** retrieval time.
- **Coverage:** Chemical Thermodynamics (First Law, Hess's Law, Enthalpy, Entropy, Gibbs Free Energy), Chemical Bonding (VSEPR, Hybridisation, Molecular Geometry), and Periodic Trends.
